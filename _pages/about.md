 I am Harihara Subrahmaniam Muralidharan and I am presently a bioinformatics engineer at [LatchBio](latch.bio). Previously, I got my Ph.D. in computer science with a focus in bioinformatics and computational biology from the [department of computer science](https://cs.umd.edu){:target="_blank"} at the University of Maryland, College Park. I had the good fortune of being advised by [Prof. Mihai Pop](https://pop-lab.org){:target="_blank"} and my work culminated in a thesis titled *"Data-driven Algorithms for Charatcterizing Structural Variation in Metagenomic Data"*. 

 Prior to graduate school, I spent 3 wonderful years at the TCS innovation labs at Chennai, India working on analytics for cyberphysical systems, mentored by Dr. Arunchandar Vasan, Dr. Venkatesh Sarangan and, Dr. Srinarayana Nagarathinam. 

 I was a research intern at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona between Feb 2015 and Jun 2015 as a part of the Semester Abroad Programme (SAP) at SASTRA University. At UPC I worked with Prof. Tomàs Aluja Banet on [Learning Analytics](https://inlab.fib.upc.edu/en/pilares){:target="_blank"} at the inLab.
